**RadioK** is an application used to manage an internet radio implemented
on a *Raspberry Pi*.

It consists of a collection of shell scripts, a web server written with
[nodejs](http://nodejs.org/) packages,
a web page built with [angularjs](https://angularjs.org/)
and a client program allowing
to control vocally the Rpi thanks
to the [Jasper](http://jasperproject.github.io/) library.

Work is still in progress but a first version is already usable by the braves.

The full documentation is available in french from 
the [RadioK](http://www.fonteny.org/radiok) dedicated web site:
