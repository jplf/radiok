RadioK is an application used to manage an internet radio implemented
on a Raspberry Pi.

It consists of a collection of shell scripts, a web server written with
nodejs packages, a web page built with angularjs and a client program allowing
to control vocally the Rpi thanks to the Jasper library.

Work is still in progress and a first version will be ready as soon as possible.
The full documentation will be available in french from this dedicated web site:
