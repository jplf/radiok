RadioK is an application used to manage an internet radio implemented
on a Raspberry Pi.

It consists of a collection of shell scripts, a web server written with
nodejs packages, a web page built with angularjs and a client program allowing
to control vocally the the Rpi thanks to the Jasper library.

Work is still in progress and will be ready as soon as possible.
The full documentation will be available in french.
